// Q2: Given 2 strings, return an array with characters that appear equal times in each string.

// EG ‘abc’, ‘bcd’ => [‘b’, ‘c’] both b and c appear once in each string
// EG ‘aaaaaaannd’, ‘ann’ => [‘n’] n appears twice in each string. a is 7 in first string and only 1 in second string so they aren’t equal.
// EG ‘hello’, ‘world’ => [‘o’] o appears once in each string. L appears in both, twice in first and only once in second so not equal.
